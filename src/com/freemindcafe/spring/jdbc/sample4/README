Always specify @Transactional on classes and let spring decide to make a jdk or cglib proxy.
If the class implements an interface then we will have jdk proxy else spring will create cglib proxy.
So we should have cglig in the classpath always.

If we have the annotation on the class, both the proxies will recognize the annotations.
Else cglib proxy will ignore the annotations defined on interface. see below for more details.

In no case we should wire based on the implementation type and not on interface type.
If we wire using implementation type then only cglib will work. And to force spring to use cglib irrespective of classes implementing interfaces,
we will have to use the following in xml configuration proxy-target-class="true". see below for more details.
