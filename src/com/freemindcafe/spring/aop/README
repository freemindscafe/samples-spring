Code related to proxy mechanism.

sample1
=======
We have a one service class 'ServiceClassWithNoInterface' that does not implement any interface.
We have one service class 'ServiceClassWithInterface' that implements 'ServiceInterface'.

1. AroundAdvice example on ServiceClassWithInterface using jdk proxy. The target proxy class being hardcoded in the code.
2. AroundAdvice example on ServiceClassWithNoInterface using jdk proxy. The target proxy class being hardcoded in the code. It should fail?
2. AroundAdvice example using cglib proxy. The target proxy class being hardcoded in the code.
3.  AroundAdvice example using cglib proxy. The target proxy class being hardcoded in the 
code. Selective methods of target beans are proxied.
4. Target beans method1 internally calls method2. That call is not through proxy.
5. Target beans method1 internally calls method2. That call is through proxy.


sample2
========
1. AroundAdvice example using cglib proxy. The target proxy class getting retrieved using a filter.
2. AroundAdvice example using jdk proxy. The target proxy being retrieved using a filter.
