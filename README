This repository will hold all the spring samples that we need time-to-time.
Samples are in the form of test cases.


Package naming conventions
----------------------------

Please use spring package names so if you are adding test case for jdbc, please add your test case under com/freemindcafe/spring/jdbc.
The individual test cases should be independent and should be able to run in isolation.

Database
----------
Apache derby database is being used as a datastore.
