This repository will hold all the spring samples that we need time-to-time.
Samples are in the form of test cases.


Guidelines
----------------------------

- Please use spring package names so if you are adding test case for jdbc, please add your test case under com/freemindcafe/spring/jdbc.
- Please create a new sample package freely. Do not try to add many test cases in a single sample package.
- All the classes, ddl, dml and wiring should be referred from that package only. It is ok to have duplcate code, ddl, dml and wiring.
- The individual test cases should be independent and should be able to run in isolation.

Database
----------
Apache derby database is being used as a datastore.

Creating an in-memory database

To create an in-memory database, specify memory as the JDBC subprotocol. 
For example, to create an in-memory database named myDB using the embedded driver, use the following connection URL:

jdbc:derby:memory:embeddedDataSource;create=true

For the network client driver, use the following connection URL. 
Because the client driver does not understand the memory subprotocol, you must include it in the database name:

jdbc:derby://myhost:1527/memory:embeddedDataSource;create=true

Be careful to specify a colon (:) after memory.
